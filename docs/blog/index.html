      <p>We wanted to keep the next day a bit light and also my friend had to go to his office for some work. So after a quick breakfast, I met my former colleague for coffee. It was great to see him, and he was the last one on my checklist of friends to meet in the US. It’s always great to meet your friend after a long time and have a good chat. Next, I headed off to the Google office where my friend was working and had a relaxing massage in one of the famous massage chairs at Google. We also had a great lunch at the Google cafeteria and I got to experience the famed gourmet Google food. After lunch, I spent the rest of the day at my friends home just lazing around and watching a movie in Netflix. I got to experience the connected home tech with Google Home at his apartment, and it was magical. That evening, I headed out to meet my cousin for dinner and after a fulfilling south Indian dinner, I headed to my cousin’s home for the rest of my stay in the US. Wishing your friends good bye is always painful and it was no different for me when I had to bid farewell to my friend.</p>

<p>The next day, we refreshed and headed out to a neighborhood mall and shopped some more. After a delicious lunch prepared by my cousins’ wife, we started our way back to home – India. The drive to airport was again special – we drove through places that hosted our office and the hotel. Looking at them, I was reminded of my time in the US – what a beautiful 2 week journey it was! Finally, we reached the airport and finished all the formalities. As I sat the boarding gate waiting for my flight boarding, I saw something dearest to me – the Indian flag on my plane. I was never more happy seeing my country flag. As the plane took off, I bid farewell to US – the land that gave me so many memories over the past 2 weeks and I signed off until the next time.</p>

<p>What did I take away from this trip? A lot of memories, some captured here some captured in my heart. This trip was special to me on more than one front – professionally and personally. Looking back, I realized that life has a perfect timing for everything for us. After a tumultuous 6 months, life rewarded me with beautiful 2 weeks of relaxation and rejuvenation – both for my body and my soul. A friend of mine always used to say – believe in the timing of God and manifestation. This US trip of mine made me realize those words and I am thankful to the God for bestowing me this memorable trip.</p>

    <time datetime="2023-10-29T00:00:00+05:30" class="post-date">29 Oct 2023</time>

    
      <p>The plan for the weekend for simple – meet my friend and drive around. We shifted my luggage to his apartment and started off for a long drive. We planned to visit Big Sur and the 17 mile drive – my dream for a very long time. Although my friend had visited them quite a few times, he was generous enough to do the trip once more with me, and it was special. We started driving at around 8:30 AM and stopped at ‘The Butter House’ for a quick charge – both for his car and for us, a delicious brunch. The restaurant had a wait time of around 45 minutes, but the food was totally worth the wait. All along the way, we had great conversation on pretty much every topic under the sun – economy, technology, jobs, life, relationships and what not.</p>

<p>The next phase of the journey to Big Sur was an extremely amazing drive – to put it in simple words. In fact, no amount of words can describe the feeling I experienced while driving along the road. Ocean on one side, beautiful winding roads ahead of you with occasional tall trees covering the sky and the creeks along side, it was a drive that has to be experienced in person. And as our luck would have it, the weather on that day was very pleasant with mild showers and cool breeze, making the drive even more relaxed and enjoyable. How can you make such drive even better? Play your favorite songs and sing along with your buddy! We stopped at a few points to catch the glimpse of the ocean next to us and the scenery was simply breath taking. Watching the ocean beneath us, I could see the pristine waves washing the sands and hitting the rocks. The pale cyan color near the shores and the dark blue waters in the distance provided a perfect amalgamation of blue shades. I was speechless at the sight of this beautiful nature and couldn’t thank enough to the God for providing me this opportunity to experience this beauty.</p>

<p>On the way back, it was my chance to drive along this beautiful route. I drove along the winding roads with ease and the whole journey of around 30 miles passed away in a breeze. All the while, my friend was enjoying the views, sitting in the passenger seat – which he hadn’t done ever since he got his car. I was glad I could help him experience that joy. The drive itself reminded me of the video games – just rotate your steering wheel to navigate the twists and turns along the way. After a long drive, we stopped at Starbucks for a quick coffee break and my friend surprised me with a gift – a special Starbucks ‘Been There’ series mug! This drive was just getting better! After this, we headed to the big destination – the 17 mile drive.</p>

<p>Now, the 17 mile drive is basically a drive along the coast of a region called Monterey that is occupied by some of the wealthiest people in the USA. This area was full of golf courses, tennis courts and beautiful mansions just a few steps away from the coast. Along the 17 miles of the drive through that region, we visited a lot of scenic places such as the Spanish Bay, Bird Rock, the lone Cypress tree, ghost trees, etc. Once again, we got onto the beach and played with the water which was freezing cold. The gentle waves touching my feet in that pristine weather was the perfect relaxation I needed. In that moment, as I stood there with my feet in the sand and gaze in the sky – I became one with the nature. I once again thanked the God for bringing me to this place – 13,000 Kms away from my home – and providing me such amazing experiences. Once we completed all the sight seeing points in the 17 mile drive, we headed over to our next destination – Carmel by the sea.</p>

<p>Carmel is a small town located close to the 17 mile drive that is adorned with beautiful European architecture. Here, you would find small buildings housing some cozy shops for art and memorabilia. Walking along the streets, I was reminded of my time in Germany and Italy. There were lanes, and then there were inner lanes through the buildings connecting the main lanes. After spending an hour or so on the streets, we headed over for dinner at a cozy little Italian restaurant called ‘La Napoli’. What better way to end your day with some warm Italian food and great music! We had the perfect vegetable soup for the cool and drizzling weather, followed by a very special pasta – the Cascadelli with basil pesto sauce adorned with nuts! Followed by an amazing vegetable pizza and to close it off, a perfect Tiramisu! What a perfect way to end the evening! After a sumptuous dinner, we headed back to the city. Along the way, we stopped at the Tesla super chargers for a quick charge. We reached home by 9:30 PM and called it a day.</p>

      <p>The next week was quite busy with work. On one of the evenings, we went to a park in San Mateo county that was right next to the sea. This park was basically a jogging/walking track with some sit-outs to enjoy the cool ocean breeze and watch the sunset/sunrise. Being close to San Francisco, we could see a number of planes arriving in San Francisco airport. After a relaxed walk along the track and watching the sunset, we headed back to our hotel stopping at a super market on the way. One evening, I met my old colleagues for dinner and it felt so nice to meet them after a long time. We had great conversation over some great Italian food and ended the evening with nice memories. On an another evening, I met my cousin who was living in San Jose. We went to Palo Alto to try out the famous ramen – we had to stand in queue for 30 minutes to get inside the restaurant. After the dinner, we had a walk around the Palo Alto downtown and had ice cream at a quirky ice cream parlor. I got to try some interesting ice cream flavors and ended the evening with sweet taste in my mouth and mind.</p>

<p>Before we could realize, it was time for us to return the rental car. But before that, I made a surprise purchase – Apple Airpods – at Best Buy. I had always wanted to buy some very good quality earphones that had active noise cancellation, single ear playback, etc. Having an iPhone, the natural choice was the Airpods Pro. Using my office credits, I made the big purchase. I must admit – the Airpods were magic! The way they paired with my iPhone, settings, controls and the build quality – everything about it screamed Apple. It’s the visceral feel of the Apple products that captures the users into its ecosystem and I was no exception. I am slowly but steadily becoming an ardent Apple fan. That evening, I finished the last of my work duties for my visit to the USA and then got ready for the weekend to have some fun.</p>

<p>Next morning was my time to check-out from the hotel and vacate my room. It would be injustice to call it just a room; it was my home for the last 2 weeks. Though it’s just a place for you to stay temporarily, you tend to develop a kind of attachment with the place and it starts growing on you slowly. I was no different – the room I stayed in had all the amenities for a perfect business stay, complete with facilities such as a mini kitchen with all the utensils needed to cook a wholesome meal, a large TV, work desk, plush bed and sofa, decent bathroom and an ironing stand. Whether it was a long day at work or a tiring drive, my room was always ready to welcome me home and relax. And the way I used to snug into the bed with the sheets on me – that gave me the warm and cozy sleep I needed. It may sound weird to get attached to a hotel room so much, but this is me. So with a heavy heart, I bid farewell to the room and proceeded with my plans.</p>

        Factfulness by Hans Rosling
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2023-08-01T00:00:00+05:30" class="post-date">01 Aug 2023</time>

    
      <p>Let’s start with a question -</p>

<p>‘There are 2 billion children in the world today, aged 0 to 15 years old. How many children will there be in the year 2100, according to the United Nations?’</p>
<ul>
  <li>A: 4 billion</li>
  <li>B: 3 billion</li>
  <li>C: 2 billion</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t try to search for an answer on the internet, take your best guess.</p>

<p>The correct answer is C. Did that surprise you? You were probably thinking along the lines of 4 billion or more, given what we currently know about the population growth in the world today. Well, you are not alone. It turns out that some of the best minds in the Governments, media, public health also are in the same boat. We are no better than chimpanzees selecting the answers(it sounds harsh, but it’s a statistical fact).</p>

<p>The question posed above is just one of the many such questions that are answered in this amazing book - Factfulness. Now, it’s not a book on just some world facts presented as quiz preparatory material. The real intention of Hans Rosling is to change the perception of the world that we carry with us all the time using real statistics from trusted sourcs such as UNO, UNICEF, The World Bank, etc. But why does he care? Or rather, why should we care about these facts?</p>

<p>Because, without the factual data, we have a very distorted view of the world around us. We often think in terms of ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ nations, ‘rich’ and ‘poor’ and many such dichotomies. In reality, it’s a very different scenario out there. Why does this matter? It matters to the leaders of the world to make better decisions in terms of spending public money. It matters to the business heads to invest their resources in better markets - where they can impact peoples lives and make money. It matters to us, as the citizens of the world to understand our own world better. So, how does Hans do it?</p>

<p>At the beginnning of this book, Hans Rosling presents us with 13 such questions with answers. He then takes each one of these questions and provides the rationale behind why we end up choosing the wrong answer using 10 human insincts that we all have. Instincts such as ‘The Gap Instinct’, ‘The Negativity Instinct’, ‘The Fear Instinct’, ‘The Generalization Instinct’ and so on. I have never come across a more delightful amalgamation of psychology, economics, statistics and inferences so far. As you read through each chapter, you will be surprised to realize how deeply ingrained those insincts are in our minds that lead us to such wrong perceptions.</p>

<p>With deeply personal stories about public healthcare in the poorest of the nations of the world, Hans Rosling takes us through the lives of extremely under privileged and needy people that are heart touching and are bound to move us to the core. If you are reading this review, you are already in Level 4(read this book to understand the levels) and there are billions of people still on Levels 2 and 3. And it takes books like these to atleast change the way we think about our people, systems and ideologies. I’m sure after reading this book, your perception of the world will change forever.</p>

<p>Fun fact - you will find a lot of unfinished houses in the city of Tunisia and people still live in them. Can you guess why? The answer will baffle you! But wait, you will have to read this book to find out!</p>

        Creative Confidence by Tom Kelly and David Kelly
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2022-08-10T00:00:00+05:30" class="post-date">10 Aug 2022</time>

    
      <p>When you hear the word “creativity”, what do you think of next?</p>

<p>This is the first line in the book ‘Creative Confidence’ by Tom Kelly and David Kelly. Take a moment and think about that question. If the words that come to your mind are along the lines of ‘drawing’, ‘art’ and ‘music’, you’re not alone. Nine out of ten times, we often conjure up the images of an artist or a painter toiling away at his/her desk ‘creating’ the next masterpiece. We rarely think of creativity in terms of it’s real dictionary meaning - the use of imagination or original ideas to create something - on in other words, ‘inventiveness’. ‘Create something’ is the key here, and it’s not limited to just the discipline of art. This is the first fundamental concept that the authors clarify in this book.</p>

<p>Now, why this book? David Kelly is the founder of the IDEO company which is excels at designing products and solutions to companies worldwide. Fun fact - IDEO designed the first manufacturable computer mouse for Apple, and one of its founders pioneered interaction design. So when I came across this book, it was surely tempting enough. And with all the drive around innovation and creativity everywhere, this book fits perfectly as the 101 book.</p>

<p>We often hear about how competetive the world is becoming and how everyone - companies and individuals alike - need to be more creative or innovative to stay ahead of the curve. While this urgency to get creative is good, what is not articulated is how we reach there. It’s not rare to hear someone in the management asking its employees to be more creative at some all-hands meet. Or organize an yearly ‘hackathon’ event, full of freebies. But this book shows us that it doesn’t need to happen once in a year or in a quarter. Through the chapters, the authors provide very clear and practical steps to get creative, in a tone that sounds more like a friend than an instructor.</p>

<p>A central idea in the book is the emphasis on ‘doing something’. It sounds very simple, but as the authors explain, this is the fundamental hindrance to start getting creative. We often have ideas, but simply lack the effort or courage to take the first step. A best example is my desire to get better at ‘writing’ - I have read multiple books on writing and grammar including ‘On Writing Well’, ‘Elements of Style’ - but it’s only when I actually started writing what you’re reading now that I started noticing changes in my writing. And I am not writing fiction or giving my perspective on a subject after deep research; it’s just writing about something I’ve read. Just this simple activity helped me explore my creative side in writing - how do I start? how does the flow go? where do I stop? how do I spark interest in the readers? Trust me, all we need is the first step! With the ideas presented in this book, I’m sure everyone can start taking that first step.</p>

<p>Here’re some interesting lines from the book:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Doubts in one’s creative ability can be cured by guiding people through a series of small successes.</li>
  <li>Fear of failure is the single biggest obstacle people face to creative success.</li>
  <li>If you want more success, you have to be prepared to shrug off more failure.</li>
  <li>Success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan. To learn from failure, however, you have to ‘own’ it.</li>
  <li>“Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain” - R.W.Emerson.</li>
  <li>“Courage is only the accumulation of small steps” - Gyorgy Konrad.</li>
  <li>“If you want a good idea, start with a lot of ideas” - Linus Pauling.</li>
  <li>“It’s not what you don’t know that gets you into trouble, it’s what you know for sure that ain’t so” - Mark Twain.</li>
  <li>Focusing our energy on the right question can make the difference between incremental improvement and breakthrough innovation.</li>
  <li>“Do or do not. There is no try.” - Yoda in Star Wars.</li>
  <li>The desire to be best can get in the way of getting better.</li>
  <li>The front end of innovation is supposed to be messy.</li>
  <li>Never go to a meeting without a prototype.</li>
  <li>Passion doesn’t preclude effort.</li>
  <li>Leaders can’t dictate culture, but they can nurture it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read, write, create, do something!</p>
