      <p>We wanted to keep the next day a bit light and also my friend had to go to his office for some work. So after a quick breakfast, I met my former colleague for coffee. It was great to see him, and he was the last one on my checklist of friends to meet in the US. It’s always great to meet your friend after a long time and have a good chat. Next, I headed off to the Google office where my friend was working and had a relaxing massage in one of the famous massage chairs at Google. We also had a great lunch at the Google cafeteria and I got to experience the famed gourmet Google food. After lunch, I spent the rest of the day at my friends home just lazing around and watching a movie in Netflix. I got to experience the connected home tech with Google Home at his apartment, and it was magical. That evening, I headed out to meet my cousin for dinner and after a fulfilling south Indian dinner, I headed to my cousin’s home for the rest of my stay in the US. Wishing your friends good bye is always painful and it was no different for me when I had to bid farewell to my friend.</p>

<p>The next day, we refreshed and headed out to a neighborhood mall and shopped some more. After a delicious lunch prepared by my cousins’ wife, we started our way back to home – India. The drive to airport was again special – we drove through places that hosted our office and the hotel. Looking at them, I was reminded of my time in the US – what a beautiful 2 week journey it was! Finally, we reached the airport and finished all the formalities. As I sat the boarding gate waiting for my flight boarding, I saw something dearest to me – the Indian flag on my plane. I was never more happy seeing my country flag. As the plane took off, I bid farewell to US – the land that gave me so many memories over the past 2 weeks and I signed off until the next time.</p>

<p>What did I take away from this trip? A lot of memories, some captured here some captured in my heart. This trip was special to me on more than one front – professionally and personally. Looking back, I realized that life has a perfect timing for everything for us. After a tumultuous 6 months, life rewarded me with beautiful 2 weeks of relaxation and rejuvenation – both for my body and my soul. A friend of mine always used to say – believe in the timing of God and manifestation. This US trip of mine made me realize those words and I am thankful to the God for bestowing me this memorable trip.</p>

    <time datetime="2023-10-29T00:00:00+05:30" class="post-date">29 Oct 2023</time>

    
      <p>The plan for the weekend for simple – meet my friend and drive around. We shifted my luggage to his apartment and started off for a long drive. We planned to visit Big Sur and the 17 mile drive – my dream for a very long time. Although my friend had visited them quite a few times, he was generous enough to do the trip once more with me, and it was special. We started driving at around 8:30 AM and stopped at ‘The Butter House’ for a quick charge – both for his car and for us, a delicious brunch. The restaurant had a wait time of around 45 minutes, but the food was totally worth the wait. All along the way, we had great conversation on pretty much every topic under the sun – economy, technology, jobs, life, relationships and what not.</p>

<p>The next phase of the journey to Big Sur was an extremely amazing drive – to put it in simple words. In fact, no amount of words can describe the feeling I experienced while driving along the road. Ocean on one side, beautiful winding roads ahead of you with occasional tall trees covering the sky and the creeks along side, it was a drive that has to be experienced in person. And as our luck would have it, the weather on that day was very pleasant with mild showers and cool breeze, making the drive even more relaxed and enjoyable. How can you make such drive even better? Play your favorite songs and sing along with your buddy! We stopped at a few points to catch the glimpse of the ocean next to us and the scenery was simply breath taking. Watching the ocean beneath us, I could see the pristine waves washing the sands and hitting the rocks. The pale cyan color near the shores and the dark blue waters in the distance provided a perfect amalgamation of blue shades. I was speechless at the sight of this beautiful nature and couldn’t thank enough to the God for providing me this opportunity to experience this beauty.</p>

<p>On the way back, it was my chance to drive along this beautiful route. I drove along the winding roads with ease and the whole journey of around 30 miles passed away in a breeze. All the while, my friend was enjoying the views, sitting in the passenger seat – which he hadn’t done ever since he got his car. I was glad I could help him experience that joy. The drive itself reminded me of the video games – just rotate your steering wheel to navigate the twists and turns along the way. After a long drive, we stopped at Starbucks for a quick coffee break and my friend surprised me with a gift – a special Starbucks ‘Been There’ series mug! This drive was just getting better! After this, we headed to the big destination – the 17 mile drive.</p>

<p>Now, the 17 mile drive is basically a drive along the coast of a region called Monterey that is occupied by some of the wealthiest people in the USA. This area was full of golf courses, tennis courts and beautiful mansions just a few steps away from the coast. Along the 17 miles of the drive through that region, we visited a lot of scenic places such as the Spanish Bay, Bird Rock, the lone Cypress tree, ghost trees, etc. Once again, we got onto the beach and played with the water which was freezing cold. The gentle waves touching my feet in that pristine weather was the perfect relaxation I needed. In that moment, as I stood there with my feet in the sand and gaze in the sky – I became one with the nature. I once again thanked the God for bringing me to this place – 13,000 Kms away from my home – and providing me such amazing experiences. Once we completed all the sight seeing points in the 17 mile drive, we headed over to our next destination – Carmel by the sea.</p>

<p>Carmel is a small town located close to the 17 mile drive that is adorned with beautiful European architecture. Here, you would find small buildings housing some cozy shops for art and memorabilia. Walking along the streets, I was reminded of my time in Germany and Italy. There were lanes, and then there were inner lanes through the buildings connecting the main lanes. After spending an hour or so on the streets, we headed over for dinner at a cozy little Italian restaurant called ‘La Napoli’. What better way to end your day with some warm Italian food and great music! We had the perfect vegetable soup for the cool and drizzling weather, followed by a very special pasta – the Cascadelli with basil pesto sauce adorned with nuts! Followed by an amazing vegetable pizza and to close it off, a perfect Tiramisu! What a perfect way to end the evening! After a sumptuous dinner, we headed back to the city. Along the way, we stopped at the Tesla super chargers for a quick charge. We reached home by 9:30 PM and called it a day.</p>

      <p>The next week was quite busy with work. On one of the evenings, we went to a park in San Mateo county that was right next to the sea. This park was basically a jogging/walking track with some sit-outs to enjoy the cool ocean breeze and watch the sunset/sunrise. Being close to San Francisco, we could see a number of planes arriving in San Francisco airport. After a relaxed walk along the track and watching the sunset, we headed back to our hotel stopping at a super market on the way. One evening, I met my old colleagues for dinner and it felt so nice to meet them after a long time. We had great conversation over some great Italian food and ended the evening with nice memories. On an another evening, I met my cousin who was living in San Jose. We went to Palo Alto to try out the famous ramen – we had to stand in queue for 30 minutes to get inside the restaurant. After the dinner, we had a walk around the Palo Alto downtown and had ice cream at a quirky ice cream parlor. I got to try some interesting ice cream flavors and ended the evening with sweet taste in my mouth and mind.</p>

<p>Before we could realize, it was time for us to return the rental car. But before that, I made a surprise purchase – Apple Airpods – at Best Buy. I had always wanted to buy some very good quality earphones that had active noise cancellation, single ear playback, etc. Having an iPhone, the natural choice was the Airpods Pro. Using my office credits, I made the big purchase. I must admit – the Airpods were magic! The way they paired with my iPhone, settings, controls and the build quality – everything about it screamed Apple. It’s the visceral feel of the Apple products that captures the users into its ecosystem and I was no exception. I am slowly but steadily becoming an ardent Apple fan. That evening, I finished the last of my work duties for my visit to the USA and then got ready for the weekend to have some fun.</p>

<p>Next morning was my time to check-out from the hotel and vacate my room. It would be injustice to call it just a room; it was my home for the last 2 weeks. Though it’s just a place for you to stay temporarily, you tend to develop a kind of attachment with the place and it starts growing on you slowly. I was no different – the room I stayed in had all the amenities for a perfect business stay, complete with facilities such as a mini kitchen with all the utensils needed to cook a wholesome meal, a large TV, work desk, plush bed and sofa, decent bathroom and an ironing stand. Whether it was a long day at work or a tiring drive, my room was always ready to welcome me home and relax. And the way I used to snug into the bed with the sheets on me – that gave me the warm and cozy sleep I needed. It may sound weird to get attached to a hotel room so much, but this is me. So with a heavy heart, I bid farewell to the room and proceeded with my plans.</p>

    <time datetime="2023-10-29T00:00:00+05:30" class="post-date">29 Oct 2023</time>

    
      <p>After the wonderful start of the trip, it was business time. We started our work on a Sunday (it was an upgrade support visit) and we had to work through the week, going to the office daily. I thought this was it – regular work followed by relaxation at the hotel in the evening. We also went out for lunch with our colleagues to some Indian restaurants in Redwood City and San Carlos and had some amazing Indian food. I had no idea about the next surprise waiting for me.</p>

<p>As it turns out, we have the facility to rent a car in the US for our daily commute from hotel to office  and we did rent the car before reaching US. But due to some confusion around the pick-up times, we missed our rental reservation and ended up not having a car. When we informed our VP about this, he asked to go ahead with a new reservation; and reserve we did. This is where it gets interesting – on the day of the pick-up, my colleague who had told me to help with picking up and driving it, couldn’t show up due to some issue. But he gave some words of caution – on the basic driving rules. Now, it was up to me to step up to the occasion and pick-up the car. As an Indian driver with no driving experience in US, I was pretty tensed while going to the car rental agency for the pickup. Call it a co-incidence, the Uber cab driver was an Indian! That was my small window of getting a crash course on ‘Driving in the USA 101’ from him. Armed with that very little knowledge and my faith in the God, I went and picked up the car. It was just a 3 mile journey to my hotel, but that accounted for one of my biggest personal achievements in recent times. The car that was allotted to us was a Nissan Altima sedan – the longest car I ever drove in my life. Luckily, it was a modern car with support navigation which helped me a lot during the drives.</p>

<p>That evening, I took up my first serious drive – a trip to the Google offices in Sunnyvale from San Carlos. It was a 20 minute drive including a few miles on the US freeway 101. This is when I had the first experience of driving on a US freeway, with suer fast vehicles zipping beside me and me struggling to keep up the pace with them. The visit to the Google office itself is an amazing experience. It started with the reception area – a huge wall adorned with real computer mother boards! This is a testament to the engineering values that Google is built upon. Past that, I witnessed some of the crazy, interesting, and fun work spaces ever. After the traditional looking Sunnyvale offices, we visited the Bay View campus – a new gem in the Google offices crown. This is an entirely different architecture with open views and airy work spaces, all nestled under a huge tent like structure. What’s interesting is that the panels on the roof open up to allow sun light, thus reducing the need for artificial light in the office buildings. It would be interesting to see such eco-friendly architectures replicated in other places too. We finished that evening with a visit to Costco to buy stuff for our colleagues in India.</p>

<p>After that came my next big drive in the US – a road trip to the Santa Cruz beach. It was a journey of almost 55 miles one way driving along freeway 101 and highway 1. Although I had an idea of how the drive on freeway 101, I had no idea how the drive on highway 1 feels like. As it turns out, it was a winding road cutting through mountains and changing altitudes all through the way. It was also one of the very scenic drives with mountains in the far and tall trees to the sides. There were sharp turns and narrow roads where I had to maintain a constant speed of 40 Mph. Though it was stressful, I can now say that that was my most adventurous drive so far. After a journey of 1.5 hours, we reached the Santa Cruz beach.</p>

<p>Now, the beach itself was very beautiful. Pair that with the perfect sunny atmosphere, this was a perfect weekend getaway. I walked on the beach, got into the water, toyed with the waves and had a lot of fun. The clear blue skies and dark blue ocean with layers of pale cyan waters made the entire scenery very relaxed and even more beautiful. We walked up to the pier and walked along it, watching seals along the way and the beautiful mansions by the beach. After spending a good 2 hours and an ice cream for lunch, we headed back to our hotel. The way back was even more interesting, since the 101 North was closed for some road work. So we had to take the freeway 280. This being a new route and me being a rookie driver in US, I made some obvious mistakes – missing some exits, drive lanes, driving through some wrong lanes and making some detours. I even had a close call with another car – it was a perfect Hollywood moment where he came too close to my car and suddenly applied the brakes – making that screeching rubber sound on the road, followed by a long honk. That was real shock to me and I was taken by a jolt. The next 45 minutes seemed like an eternity, all the while me regretting my choice to drive the car so long. But, after a brave show on the road, we finally reached the hotel and relaxed for a while before heading out to San Carlos downtown for an evening walk.</p>

<p>San Carlos downtown was a typical US city marketplace – streets lined with road side restaurants, shops, bakeries, banks, parks and a vibrant population lacing them. The walk in the evening was very relaxing one, especially after the tiring drive in the day. We checked out a bakery called ‘Paris Baguette’ – specializing in French bakery food. Surprisingly, this is a popular bakery chain in the US that is owned and run by Korean management. That evening, my dinner was a platter with some delicious food – a chocolate croissant, a pineapple cream brulee, a cheese apple tart and some warm chai. What a sweet way to end a day!</p>

        USA Trip 2023 - Reflections - Part 1

    <time datetime="2023-10-29T00:00:00+05:30" class="post-date">29 Oct 2023</time>

    
      <p>Today is my last day in USA as part of my business trip to Informatica HQ. The past two and a half weeks have been some of my best days in this year. Although I had many business trips in the past, this particular one has been the most memorable and this is something that I will cherish for a long time. And as this trip comes to an end, it makes sense for me to pen down my reflections – in the hope of cementing my memories for a long time to come.</p>

<p>This year started off a little rough – with my health and my family health taking a toll. Once we recovered, we suffered a personal loss that made an even bigger impact. What’s more, we had to go through a lot of hardship due to some issues in our apartment. On the work front, I was handed the ownership of a very critical component in our product about which I had very little awareness. An interesting twist here is the opportunity I got to attend our company’s annual conference in Las Vegas and present our work to customers and partners. This experience itself deserves a separate post, which I plan to write sometime soon.</p>

<p>Soon after the Vegas conference, we had to gear up for our next major release work, which was due in October. I, along with my maverick team of 3 – had no clue on what we were signing up for. This assignment provided me a great opportunity to build a team from scratch, all the while juggling between project prep and skill development. What started as a few simple requirements quickly grew into 4 major features. The math here is simple – 4 engineers, 4 features; right? No. The fourth one on the team was me – and I had to play the role of architect, developer and coach. So it was design, reviews, coaching and coordinating with other teams during the day while writing the code for my feature in the evenings and weekends. This went on for 4 months – from June to September. I was totally worked up and stressed and then the US trip came along my way.</p>

<p>A month ago, when my manager asked me if I was willing to travel to the US for support activities, I signed up – this time again not knowing what to expect. Maybe this is a pattern with me, but I digress. The only relief that I got about the trip was knowing that I was accompanied by 2 other engineers – who were veterans in the upgrade support. So, gathering my strength from these other 2 brave souls, I marched on. The next month went on in a snap and before I realized, I was at the swanky new T2 airport at 6:15 AM, waiting to board my flight to the USA.</p>

<p>I have a few friends living in California and I had informed one of them about my travel plans. Little did I know that he would later play an important role in creating amazing memories during my stay in the US. So, the day after we landed in US, I informed my friend and he offered to drop by my hotel and take me out. And that was the beginning of my journey of memories. We went out to have some good Indian/Pakistani food for brunch and then headed out to visit some places around. We visited Pulgas Water Temple, Point Bonita light house in San Fransisco then headed to the Stanford University (yes, THE Stanford University). This was also my first time driving a car in the USA. And guess which one I drove? A swanky new Tesla Model Y! Being a geek, you can only imagine the excitement I had when I drove one of the most advanced artifacts of technology in the automotive industry. Also, for the first time in my life, I experienced fully autonomous self-driving system in a passenger car. I was totally blown away by the driving chops of the Tesla’s autonomous driving system. The precision and accuracy with which it navigated the paths – be it hilly roads or freeways or the busy streets of San Francisco, this was beyond my imagination. I just could not help but appreciate how far humanity has come in terms of technological advancement.</p>

<p>After the wonderful experience of driving a Tesla, we reached our colleague’s home. There we were treated to a delicious Indian dinner - rajma curry with roti. Could I have asked for a better start to the trip?</p>
