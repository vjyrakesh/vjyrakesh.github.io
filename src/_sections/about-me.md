I am Rakesh Kasibhatla, Software Engineer by profession. I am a technology enthusiast, always curious about the latest happenings in the tech scene. I love learning new technology - be it programming languages, frameworks or just simple tools. I belive that constantly engaging myself in these activities keeps my mind active and focused.

I like building stuff - whether it's Lego or software, there's always an active project on my mind apart from the regular work stuff. Apart from software and tech, reading books is my other favorite pastime. You can find the reviews of the books I've read so far.
